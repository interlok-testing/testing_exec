Project tests interlok-exec features

## What it does

This project contains a single Interlok instance that demonstrates executing scripts on the host operating system.

We have a single workflow that will trigger every five seconds creating a new file in the __failed_messages__ directory.  Then every thirty seconds a windows batch script will execute a __del__ of that directory.
